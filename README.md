# ConcRist — Concrete Metaheuristics

<p align="center"><i>The word concrete is borrowed from a famous book ConCrete mathematics and is decrypted as «Continuous&amp;Discrete Mathematics»</i></p>

Concrete Metaheuristics building blocks (MHBB) written in Rust

Major design goals:
- Maximize flexibility: Provide many layers and allow users to plug their code to any of them
- Minimize the probability that library design will make a metaheuristic algorithm impossible to be implemented from those blocks
- Minimize the probability that users will need to write some code, which is common for MH algorithms, by their hands
